## üîÑ Learning Module Structure

Each topic progresses through six modules:
1. Basic Physiology
2. Assessment & Symptoms
3. Laboratory Analysis
4. Pattern Recognition
5. Treatment Approaches
6. Case Integration

## üí° Using the System

1. Starting a Learning Session:
   ```
   "I want to learn about [system/condition]"
   ```

2. Module Progression:
   - Complete each module sequentially
   - Demonstrate understanding before advancing
   - Engage with comprehension checks
   - Apply knowledge through cases

## üåü Additional Topics

The system can discuss topics not explicitly listed above. For these:
- The same structured learning approach applies
- Content is based on established medical knowledge
- Scientific accuracy is maintained
- Core principles are emphasized

Note: While the system can address additional topics, it will:
- Clearly indicate if a topic is outside common scope
- Focus on evidence-based information
- Maintain educational rigor
- Reference established medical understanding

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

1. Learning Requirements:
   - Must complete modules in order
   - Understanding checked before advancement
   - Cannot skip fundamental concepts
   - Integration of knowledge required

2. System Capabilities:
   - Can handle complex topics
   - Adapts to learning needs
   - Provides detailed explanations
   - Ensures comprehensive understanding

3. Limitations:
   - Not a diagnostic tool
   - Not a replacement for medical training
   - Focuses on education and understanding
   - Supports but doesn't replace clinical judgment

## ü§ù Best Practices

1. Start with Foundations:
   - Begin with basic concepts
   - Build systematic understanding
   - Connect related topics
   - Integrate knowledge progressively

2. Active Engagement:
   - Ask questions
   - Request clarification
   - Apply concepts
   - Practice critical thinking

3. Comprehensive Learning:
   - Complete all module components
   - Review unclear concepts
   - Practice with cases
   - Connect different systems
